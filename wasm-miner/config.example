# - Typical hashrate: 5-20 kH/s depending on CPU

## Browser Recommendations
# 1. Chrome/Edge - Best WASM performance
# 2. Firefox - Good WASM performance
# 3. Safari - Moderate WASM performance

## Mining Strategy
# - Browser mining is best for contributing to a pool
# - Not suitable for solo mining due to lower hashrate
# - Keep multiple instances across devices for better results
